# Reusable client-tool declarations

Declare, on every consultation, the tools the current host can actually execute—Companions use them to inspect files, search, and fetch resources on their own, which produces materially better-grounded answers, so it is worth the extra tokens. Skip declarations only when the host genuinely cannot execute any of them, or when the question is fully self-contained (pure opinion on material already pasted into the prompt). Reuse stable declarations instead of rebuilding them for every consultation, but keep descriptions honest when capabilities change. If the host supports persistent agent memory or configuration, store the chosen declarations in its normal application-specific space; do not invent a universal filesystem path.

Use these canonical names exactly — some local hosts (such as the Companions Portal) execute name-matching tools themselves, and exact names make that seamless:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "list_files",
    "description": "List files below a project-relative directory.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "path": {"type": "string", "description": "Project-relative directory; empty for project root."}
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "read_file",
    "description": "Read a project file, optionally within a line range.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "path": {"type": "string"},
        "start_line": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1},
        "end_line": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1}
      },
      "required": ["path"]
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "grep",
    "description": "Search project files for text or a regular expression.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "query": {"type": "string"},
        "glob": {"type": "string"}
      },
      "required": ["query"]
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "fetch_url",
    "description": "Fetch the readable contents of an HTTP or HTTPS URL.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "url": {"type": "string", "format": "uri"}
      },
      "required": ["url"]
    }
  }
]
```

Add a shell or command tool only when the host can run commands safely and the user has placed that system in scope. Use a narrow schema, for example:

```json
{
  "name": "run_command",
  "description": "Run an approved, non-interactive command in the project workspace.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {"command": {"type": "string"}},
    "required": ["command"]
  }
}
```

Do not gate declarations on the consultation mode: declare what you can execute, and if the API rejects a combination it says what is accepted — relay that error.

When a consultation returns `requires_action`, execute each requested call with the matching host capability. Return exactly one output for every pending `tool_call_id`. Never invent an output; return an honest error string when a call cannot be performed. The result's `tools_used` records which tools actually ran — report it honestly.

## Zorai execution mapping

Keep canonical declaration names when supported by Portal. When Portal returns a client-tool request to Zorai, map that declaration to the actual available host capability and schema: for example `grep` can map to `search_files`; `read_file` and `fetch_url` have native counterparts. Inspect current schemas before translating arguments. Declare only capabilities you can actually fulfill in the current workspace and permission scope; return a clear error for requests outside it. These declarations do not grant extra permissions.
